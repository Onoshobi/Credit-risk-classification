The purpose of this report is to analyse whether the model is able to predict the risk profile related to each loans based on the information received.

From the confusion matrix we got following information,

-> True Positives (TP): 18655
    These are the instances where the model correctly predicted high-risk loans (1).

-> False Negatives (FN): 110
    These are the instances where the model failed to identify actual high-risk loans, predicting them as healthy (0).

-> True Negatives (TN): 583
    These are the instances where the model correctly predicted healthy loans (0).

-> False Positives (FP): 36
    These are the instances where the model incorrectly predicted healthy loans as high-risk (1).

From the classification report we got,

In High risk loan '1', 
The model shows excellent precision and recall, indicating strong predictive capability.That is Precision is ~100% and Recall is ~99%.which demonstrates excellent performance in predicting high-risk loans, indicating a very low false positive rate and effectively identifying nearly all actual high-risk cases.

In other hand, Healthy loan '0', 
For healthy loans, while precision remains decent, recall reveals that there are missed opportunities to identify healthy loans accurately.That is Precision is ~94.2% and Recall is ~84.1%.While the model performs adequately in predicting healthy loans, it shows a relatively lower recall, suggesting that approximately 15.9% of actual healthy loans are misclassified as high-risk.

In summary, the confusion matrix and classification_report reveals that the model excels in identifying high-risk loans and there is also chance of imporvement on this model particularly in enhancing the recall for healthy loans. This could involve further tuning the model, adjusting thresholds, or exploring additional features, which the company can invest in post-deployment.

At the last, I highly recommand this model to be used in the company because of the High Precision and Recall for High-Risk Loans.It also performs well for Healthy Loans as well although the model's recall for healthy loans is not as strong, the overall precision remains high.
